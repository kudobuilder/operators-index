# Contributing Guidelines

The KUDO Operators Index project accepts contributions via GitHub pull requests. This document outlines the process to help get your contribution accepted.

## Developer Certificate Of Origin

KUDO Operators requires that contributors sign off on changes submitted to kudobuilder repositories.
The [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) is a simple way to certify that you wrote or have the right to submit the code you are contributing to the project.

You sign-off by adding the following to your commit messages:

    This is my commit message

    Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>

Git has a `-s` command line option to do this automatically.

    git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'

You can find the full text of the DCO here: https://developercertificate.org/
