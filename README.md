# KUDO Operators Index

*Alpha quality, this is still being tested!*

Index of the community operators for KUDO.

Each item in `operators` references one or more versions of an operator package. The community repository is build from the referenced packages. There's a one-to-one relationship between the referenced items in the index and the packages in the community repository.

## Current Limitations

* Operators and versions cannot be removed from the index yet
* Only operators compatible with the latest KUDO release can be added
